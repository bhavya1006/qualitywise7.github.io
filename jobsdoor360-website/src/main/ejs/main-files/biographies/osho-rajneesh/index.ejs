        <div class="intro">
            <strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
            Osho Rajneesh was born in <strong>1931</strong> in a modest Jain family in <strong>Kuchwada village, Madhya Pradesh, India.</strong>
            His father, <strong>Babulal Jain</strong>, was a small cloth trader, and his mother, <strong>Saraswati Jain</strong>, was a homemaker with deep spiritual influence. He was the eldest of eleven siblings.
            Though not poor, the family lived simply in rural India, where philosophical discussion and religious practice were common in daily life.
            Financially, the family would be considered lower-middle class by 2025 standards, with an estimated annual income of less than ₹1 lakh/year.
            From an early age, <strong>Osho</strong> showed signs of deep intellectual and spiritual curiosity. His maternal grandparents played a significant role in his formative years.
